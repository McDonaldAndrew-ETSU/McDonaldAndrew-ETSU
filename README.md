   - I'm interested in using my **Full Stack Programming** and **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning** experience to find a job doing these working remotely!
   - Outside of school, and besides coding new and original software applications, one of my favorite projects/hobbies is  learning how to alter, decipher, and translate **.bin** files of vehicular Engine Control Units/Modules (ECU's/ECM's) and Powertrain Control Modules (PCM's) in order to optimize engine and transmission performance.  This is also known as "***Tuning***"!
