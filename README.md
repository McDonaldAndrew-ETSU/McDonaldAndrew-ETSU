job where I can work from home!
   - Outside of school, one of my favorite projects/hobbies is learning how to alter, decipher, and translate **.bin** files of vehicular Engine Control Units/Modules (ECU's/ECM's) and 
Powertrain Control Modules (PCM's) in order to optimize engine and transmission performance.  This is known as "***Tuning***"!
