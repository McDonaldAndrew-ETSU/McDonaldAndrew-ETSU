   - I'm interested in using my **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning** experience to find a job implementing this working remotely!
   - Outside of school, besides training one of my newest AI/ML models, coding software applications, or creating Operating Systems for micro-controllers, one of my favorite projects/hobbies is learning how to alter, decipher, and translate **.bin** files of vehicular Engine Control Units/Modules (ECU's/ECM's) and Powertrain Control Modules (PCM's) in order to optimize engine and transmission performance.  This is also known as "***Tuning***"!
